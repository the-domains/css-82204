# ..ok I know..

"We bought the grid so we wouldn't have to do any 'coding'... Molly is meant to design everything for me..!"

We've had this conversation many times, but sometimes.. just maybe.. it might be ok just to utilize a little bit of css on your grid site. In the examples below, all the code is shown, so really you only have to copy anyway.. 🙄

In the embedded html window tho, remember that we have to put all the css between <style\>..... </style\> tags..
